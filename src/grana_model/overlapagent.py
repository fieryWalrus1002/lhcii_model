"""Overlap reduction agent

This module implements an agent that attempts to reduce overlap between objects
in the simulation, and strategies that it can follow to perform this duty. 

Can be run from the command line by calling a SimulationEnvironment, or used as part of the SimulationWindow.
No command line arguments are required, but are going to be implemented so I can run this on Kamiak in the future.

Example:
    $ overlap_agent = OverlapAgent(area_strategy=chosen_strategy, time_limit=1000,
        space=space)
    $ overlap_agent.run()

    or 

    $ py3 -m overlap_agent.py
    

Todo:
    * everything. abstract strategies, coding the overlap agent, etc.
